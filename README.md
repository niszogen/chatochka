# Chatichka
Chatichka is a simple peer-to-peer chat website that allows two people to, well, chat with each other. It is made using the classic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript trio, with the addition of [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com) for the connection between the peers.

## Usage
Simply go to the [official link](https://chatichka.bemxio.xyz), host the website yourself, or open the `index.html` file in your browser.

You'll be asked to enter your name. After that, Chatichka will give you a peer ID, share it with the person you want to chat with. To connect with you, they'll have to enter your peer ID in the input field and click the "here" button. If everything goes well, you'll both get a notification that you're connected and you'll be able to chat with each other.
